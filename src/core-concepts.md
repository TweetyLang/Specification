# 1.1 Core Concepts and Goals
TweetyLang is built around several fundamental principles and objectives:

1. **Developer Experience**

TweetyLang heavily emphasises a strong developer experience. The language and its relative implementation/toolchain should be intuitive, as frictionless as possible, and predictable.

2. **Portability**

TweetyLang is designed to run across platforms and environments. Its architecture should enable code that can be deployed without relying on a runtime environment, external dependencies, or Just-In-Time compilation.

3. **Memory Safety**

The language provides language-integrated options for writing memory safe code whilst still exposing 'legacy' memory models (i.e., raw pointers) to interop with non-memory safe code.

4. **Language Interoperability**

The language should provide capability to integrate with assemblies produced by other languages, offering first class support for native assemblies.
