# 5.1 Struct Declaration
A Struct declaration consists of optional modifier keywords, followed by the `struct` keyword, it's identifier and then its body.

```tweety
export struct MyStruct 
{
    // Struct Body
}
```

A Struct body can consist of [functions](functions.md), [fields](fields.md) and [properties](properties.md).
